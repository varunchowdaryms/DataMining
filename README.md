# Password Security Analysis using Data Mining

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and assess password security using data mining techniques. With a focus on identifying weak passwords, the analysis leverages machine learning models to classify passwords based on complexity and other attributes.

## Features
- Utilization of public datasets like RockYou, Have I Been Pwned, and SecLists.
- Implementation of a Random Forest classifier to predict password strengths.
- In-depth analysis of password characteristics such as length, diversity, and common patterns.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
python3

### Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:
