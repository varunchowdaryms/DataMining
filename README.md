# Password Security Analysis using Data Mining

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and assess password security using advanced data mining techniques. With a focus on identifying weak passwords, the analysis leverages machine learning models to classify passwords based on complexity and other attributes.

## Features
- Utilization of public datasets like RockYou, Have I Been Pwned, and SecLists.
- Implementation of a Random Forest classifier to predict password strengths.
- In-depth analysis of password characteristics such as length, diversity, and common patterns.
